## 🧩 Challenge Description

A suspicious `garden.png` file was provided. The hint suggested using a hex editor to analyze the file. Our goal was to extract any hidden information or flag possibly embedded within the image file.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- `xxd` – to create a hex dump
- Text editor – to analyze the dumped content
- Command line tools (`cat`, `grep`)

---

## 🛠️ Steps Taken

1. **Downloaded** the provided `garden.png` file.

2. Based on the hint, we researched **hex editors** and learned that they allow us to analyze file structures in hexadecimal and ASCII.
3. We used the following command to dump the contents of the image:
   ```bash
   xxd garden.png > dump.txt
4. We intially tried:
  cat dump.txt | grep picoCTF
5. However, it did not return anything useful. We then manually inspected the ASCII output in dump.txt. We use gedit to inspect dump.txt and use "ctrl + f" to search for keywords.
  gedit dump.txt
6. We discovered the flag embedded within the image data.
  picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y33dd2eEF5}
